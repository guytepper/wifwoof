A price tracker for the world's best asset.

## Installation

I've been using [`bun`](https://bun.sh/) and I recommend using it for package installation and running the project.

If you prefer to use `npm`, `yarn` or `pnpm` for package installation, feel free to do so - just make sure not to commit lockfiles generated by them.

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

If you encounter any issues during installation and would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out!

> Price updates are mocked in development mode, so you can develop hassle free.  
> We use Firebase Realtime Database to listen to price changes in production.
